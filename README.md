# CPEN 444: Introduction to Cybersecurity
Security risks, threats, and vulnerabilities from technical perspectives; confidentiality, integrity, and hybrid policies; cryptography, access control, assurance, accountability, and engineering of secure systems.

## Assignment 2: Playfair Cipher Breaker
First, familiarize yourself with the Playfair cipher by watching the videos below:

- Playfair Cipher [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quKhvu2tPy8).
- Playfair Cipher [mechanics](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2uykh1e24k5hr10/02-Playfair%20Cipher.pdf).
- 
Then, download this [file](https://blogs.ubc.ca/cpen442/files/2022/08/cipher2.txt) and find the cipher-text assigned to your group. The cipher-text is encrypted with Playfair. Your job is to find the encryption key, and then decrypt the text. Submit a report that contains the following:

- (5 points) The recovered plain text (exactly as recovered, no need to add spaces or punctuation)
- (2 points) A brief explanation of how one could infer that the text is encrypted with Playfair (in case it was not known),
- (3 points) The recovered key, and
- (7 points) A brief description of the steps you took for recovering the key (include a Github link to any code you developed to solve the problem).
